# uncertainty-deep-learning
Quantifying what neural networks don't know and when they should abstain from making predictions is an important goal for safe real-world decision-making. This project will involve designing algorithms that can quantify uncertainty in neural networks and explore their applications towards noisy labels, outlier detection, interpretability, and robustness.
